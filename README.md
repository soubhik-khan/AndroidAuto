This is a delayed shutdown solution for a Car head unit(Android Auto based on OpenAuto Pro running on a Raspberry Pi). Generally if we power up the RPI from the cigarette lighter plug, it will turn off abuptly as soon as the the ignition key is switched off. Repeating this over and over may damage the board or kill the SD card very soon! To avoid this and have a graceful soft shutdown of the RPI, I have built this module based on a timer relay(FRM01).
